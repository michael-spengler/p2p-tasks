# Values & Spirit
Shall be built in the spirit of Web3  
1. high degree of decentralization (e.g. deployed as permaapp via arweaveapps)  
2. high degre of interoperability (e.g. via linked data - [the solid approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5eKqM8-OA))  
3. high cohesion and loose coupling of modules  

# Background to Values and Spirit

# History
Peer 2 Peer Enterprise as it is before the Hackathon is integrated / bound to only one issue / task platform (e.g. github). This turned out to be bad - not only due to company internal github instances.
